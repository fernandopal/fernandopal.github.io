          <p>I'm Fernando, I was born on Seville (Spain) in the year 2000</p>
          <p>During the last years I've learning some programming lenguages at the same time I was studying and making some projects. Programming for me has been a way to escape from daily life and mantain my mind occupied doing something.</p>
          <p>I don't see myself as an expert on any of the lenguages that I've learned but I always try to learn new things and find challenges to join, think on projects that are going to make me go out of my comfort zone and they will make me find a new way to do the things (almost all that projects don't go to anywhere, that projects are only "exercises" for me)</p>
          <p>The most important thing for me is that I have fun doing what I do</p>

              <p>This was my second year on the world of programming. Almost all that I did was some <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/fernandopal.154969/">plugins</a> for a game (minecraft) using a library called <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-spigot/">spigot</a>, nothing big but it was so helpful to learn new things.<br><br>If I remember it well at the end of this year I started "working" as developer on a <a href="https://twitter.com/MineBone_es">minecraft server</a>, taking care of the virtual machine that we had rented, the webpage and some other things like custom plugins.</p>

              <h3>2017</h3>
              <p>This was my last year as part of the minecraft comunity and at the end of 2017 I left the game and all the projects related to it.<br><br>I had an idea in my head, make a Discord bot but my problem was that I had no idea of how to start so I started searching for information in google and a few months looking at tutorials and trying things I decided to start my first "big" project and create a discord bot focused on music under the name of <a href="https://www.ferchy.xyz/">Ferchy</a> (This name appeared when I was collecting ideas for the bot).<br><br>Oh, I bought my first arduino and I'm trying to learn a bit of C++ to use it.</p>

              <p>I entirely recoded Ferchy from scratch this year, changing the original idea and leaving Ferchy as a "Multiprupose bot" without music commands because I wanted to leave the music commands to other bot and this is how FerchyMusic was born, this bot has been active since 2018 hosted by a <a href="https://angelsocias.com/">friend</a> for almost half year.<br><br>This year I also started coding this website and trying some different ideas for it.</p>
